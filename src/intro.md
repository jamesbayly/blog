# About Me and this Website

I'm enjoying a premature retirement to travel the world with my camera (or at least till money runs out).

Instead of writing in an old diary to be shunned away and and forgotten, I'm doing a stupid thing and publishing my thoughts and recollections from on the road for you to read or express bewilderment at.

Follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/j_bayly/)

If you need to get in contact with me, you can do so via [james@bayly.xyz](mailto:james@bayly.xyz).
