Golden hour is roll time. As the sky yellows, people pour out of rental shops in borrowed history and converge in the same photogenic spots. The real attractions aren't the temples or gates, they're just backgrounds. The moon gate, the span of an old bridge, the red wall that makes skin tones pop - this is where the action occurs.

This is a production. Private photographers move in pairs: one with the lens and one with a reflector. There are rolling cases, stepladders, collapsible softboxes, battery packs that look like they could jump a car. Hair gets sprayed into compliance, collars straightened, sleeves smoothed, lip gloss perfected.

It's the energy most of us save for a wedding day: hours of prep for a few clean frames.

The gear culture is impressive for a nerd like myself. Every city seems thick with young shooters carrying performatively large cameras, dated but the bigger the better, with flashes riding shotgun even when the light is soft and generous (that flash isn't necessary, but it signals you're serious to the uninitiated). Strolling around with iPads showing their portfolio. They work the angles, encouraging nervous couples and parents with restless kids.

What you notice, beyond the outfits and the choreography, is timing. People emerge late in the day, every day - you can set a watch to it like a tide. Clothes rented for all participants, hair done, hours worth of makeup set. The light goes honey, shadows lengthen, and everyone starts shooting.

It isn't just the Chinese, though they're the most serious about it. Japanese families come through with the same deliberation. The economy has adjusted around the big sites in these countries. Fewer homogenous souvenir stalls; more rental houses, makeup bars, quick tailors, and pop-up "studios" that can kit you out in ten minutes and make you look like you planned this for weeks.

Call it an outrageous obsession for the perfect Instagram or the Red Book if you want. This is a serious maintenance of a public self, a photographic archive built with purpose, a collection of photos to stand out from your millions of peers. It does look strange: lines of people dressed like a memory, one after another, all angling for the same shot. But as odd as it seems, it's sure pretty.
