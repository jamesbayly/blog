It starts with a suggestion, "just go, I ended up staying there for weeks". Next thing you know, you’re on a minivan climbing the switchbacks to Pai. Or you’re barefoot on a ferry bound for Gili Trawangan, your hair dusted in sand and regret.

Once you’ve been around a few hostels in Asia you’ll start hearing the names: Pai, Gili T, Siquijor, Pushkar, Vang Vieng—a constellation of places orbiting in your daydreams. Out here, deadlines mean the next visa run. Job titles mean nothing. Everyone is five years younger than they claim or ten years older than they look, clothed in a patchwork of stretched singlets and accesorised in hemp.

![At least these places are usually in visually stunning areas of the world](https://photos.smugmug.com/Thailand-Pai/i-kmFz5SJ/0/KVK65PXCjDgjQnVSrTWhqDns7NTwC9TTZbK4qL8Bq/X2/DJI_0721-X2.jpg)

These are black hole towns, destinations with gravitational pull strong enough to bend time and warp willpower. Days lose their edges, bleeding into each other like a dropped watercolour. The soundtrack is a lazy blend of reggae and bad acoustic guitar, slackline snaps, and European accents talking about the meaning of life. Hair grows wild; laundry and personal hygiene is a kind of abstract expressionism.

Weed is everywhere—hanging thick in dark bamboo bars. In Vang Vieng or the back alleys of Gili. Happy pizzas and mushroom shakes are proudly listed on menus, and the glazed pupils in the room show that it’s a popular option. The blinding midday light might catch glazed pupils, but nobody seems to mind.

Luxury hotels and resorts don’t fit here. These are lands of hammocks, hostels, and homestays. In many cases, long-timers even run the joints, and the hottest job is volunteering at a hostel for an indeterminate amount of time. Locals either tolerate the parade or have joined in - running a bar, organising dubious "yoga sessions", getting paid in joints and stories. In the evening, the travelling tribe converges for the "family dinner" - a misnomer if ever there was one, but it fills the empty corners of cheap restaurants and even lonelier hearts.

There’s beauty, sure. Pink sunsets bleeding into paddy fields. Bracing cold rivers. Ecstatic dancing and bonfires under stars. But there’s a dark edge, too - shadows lean long at sunset. Somewhere amid the communal drift lurk the "old timers" - those who came chasing new beginnings and stayed far too long, their smiles a little too fixed, their attention all too available for fresh newcomers with soft laughter and minds to open.

But that’s the appeal for a certain type: somewhere between freedom and escape, self-discovery and self-erasure. For every sunrise yoga or spiritual epiphany, there’s an overdosed kid who never left, a promising future that got lost in rice whiskey, fire dancing, and repetition.

Doesn’t paradise wear thin when stretched across too many vacant afternoons?

Still, most come to Asia’s drifter capitals and leave lighter, with an extra story or scar. But some get swallowed up, ego and ambition stripped to a hammock sway and a blind spot where their future used to be.

**Time stands still, or maybe it just disappears. And the bus going out usually leaves half-empty.**
