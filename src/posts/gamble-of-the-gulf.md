From the restaurant of the 5 star hotel I’ve got 3 nights in as part of my heavily subsidised stopover of this former flyover state, I drink tea wishing there was a cold beer on the menu. Outside, and across the bay, the city's skyscrapers twist toward heaven in impossible shapes—glass-and-steel monuments to what money can command when freed from the constraints of reason or restraint.

Contradiction always makes a place more interesting, and few contradictions are as stark as the modern Gulf state. Here in Qatar, as in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, history happened in fast-forward. In a single lifetime, nomadic Bedouin societies transformed into hyper-modern city-states, their traditional dirt poor pearling economies replaced by something far more valuable - black gold burst from the ground. Not a trickle, but a goddamn geyser.

The wealth accumulated here defies comprehension. Before the 1950s, these were among the poorest places on earth. Today, the Al Thani family of Qatar controls a sovereign wealth fund worth over $450 billion. The story repeats across the Gulf: few Emirs, Sultans, Sheikhs who, through the accident of geography and the blessing of geology, found themselves sitting atop the world's most valuable resource. What followed was perhaps history's greatest privatisation of public wealth—natural resources becoming dynastic fortunes.

Wealth beyond the comprehension of emperors, gained not by the slow laying of bricks or construction of trade routes, but sucked out of the earth in a geological blink. Obscene? Yeah, that word gets thrown around. It barely scratches the surface. It’s wealth that reshapes coastlines, buys islands, funds armies, and builds cities from scratch in deserts.

Let's not bullshit ourselves about Western complicity. The uncomfortable truth is that the West has always preferred stable autocrats to fragile democracies when it comes to energy security. We helped install them, armed them, shook their hands, and protected them. We looked the other way as these strongmen crushed dissent, killed journalists, violated rights, made war, and funnelled billions into private accounts. We ignored migrant workers toiling in lethal heat, entire systems of modern servitude. All we asked was that the oil keep flowing and that they invest those petrodollars back into our economies. A devil's bargain if there ever was one.

Doha. Dubai. Abu Dhabi. These glittering Xanadus shimmering in the haze.

And now? Now, everyone knows the well is running low, the world is burning, and the old model is slipping—only doomers and romantics count on oil forever. So, the race to diversify is on - the great gamble of the gulf. Doha raises museums and stadiums; Dubai keeps adding to its pile of global trade, real estate, and finance wizardry. Riyadh dreams of its own geometrically insane supercities that might never rise from the sand. I can’t help but feel all of this is cosmetic. What is a city, if not a living thing—a place with stories in the bricks, sweat and love in the bricks, loss and memory? These engineered marvels are palaces, but they feel like elaborate stage sets waiting for actors who never quite arrive. Where are the people?

Can air-conditioned luxury in the desert really compete in a post-oil world? Outside, it's 106°F—a cruel irony that these nations, which contributed so significantly to global carbon emissions, will be among the first to become uninhabitable as the climate changes. By 2050, summer temperatures here could regularly exceed 140°F. No amount of engineering can make that pleasant.

And while the air outside still shimmers, even hours past sunset. It’s that kind of heat that settles deep in your bones, the kind that makes tarmac soft and thoughts hazy. Inside, though, it’s arctic. Conditioned air so cold it feels like a statement, another layer of the impossible wealth coating everything here like diamond dust.

Can you really build a sustainable, vibrant society on tourism when the main attractions are still hollow? Can you lure the world's brightest minds, the coders, the creatives, the infamous 'digital nomads,' to these golden cages? Maybe for a while. The zero-tax promise is a powerful drug. But these are fickle mobile people, chasing the path of less resistance. What happens when the coffers start to dwindle? When the state can't afford to subsidise everything? When that dreaded T-word – Tax – finally gets whispered, then shouted? You think they'll stick around for the bone-aching heat, the cultural restrictions, the surveillance, and the lack of genuine, messy, organic nightlife?

Doha, you and your sisters—Dubai, Abu Dhabi—are these insane desert Disneylands. There's something undeniably compelling about them, these impossible cities jutting from the sand. They represent humanity's unshakable belief that enough money and ambition can buy eternity. Maybe they'll pull it off. Maybe this insane gamble in the gulf will actually work. So what happens when the oil dream dies and the tide goes out? Will you still shimmer, or will you fade back into the sands?
